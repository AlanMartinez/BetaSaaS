# YTText AI Website

This repository contains a multi‑page website built with Tailwind CSS for the SaaS product **YTText AI**. The tool extracts and transcribes text from any YouTube video and lets users download the subtitles as a `.txt` file.

Pages included:

- `index.html` – landing page with a YouTube URL input
- `features.html` – overview of product features
- `pricing.html` – pricing plans
- `about.html` – background information and how the tool works
- `contact.html` – contact form and FAQ

The JavaScript (`script.js`) handles subtitle downloading and a basic contact form submission message.
